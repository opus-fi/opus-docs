As our DEX is an exchange with automated market maker type, there is need to have liquidity pool before an ERC-20 is being traded. 

On the launch of $OPUS token, we will push incentivization for liquidity providers, meaning LP providers will be massively rewarded and incentivized by $OPUS token by depositing LP tokens. The reward is given in the form of $OPUS, and not all pools are rewarded. To learn pools that will be incentivized, stay tuned for the launch.

# Stake

Once the Opus token ($OPUS) is released, holders can be rewarded by staking their $OPUS tokens to maximize their returns.

When you deposit your $OPUS tokens into the staking page, you will receive their variation in return: $xOPUS. xOPUS is a ERC-20 token you will get in exchange of staking your regular $OPUS tokens. A single $xOPUS will always worth more than the regular $OPUS token since $xOPUS accrues value from protocol usage (protocol fees).

When users make trades on Opus platform using the swap features, a small percentage of fees is deducted. This fee later will be added to the pool, then later will be sold to give dividents for $xOPUS holders. More info on this will come as we are nearing the Opus tokenomics detail launch and the release of $OPUS token to mainnet.

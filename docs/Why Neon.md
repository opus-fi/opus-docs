__Neon EVM__ is an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) built on Solana blockchain. With this way, developers can use existing Ethereum developer tooling to build their applications on top of Solana via Neon. Neon EVM is not layer-2 blockchain, rather it is a tool that enables Ethereum-compatible specification transactions to be accepted on Solana â€” taking full advantages on Solana such as parallel execution.

It is literally best of both worlds. Ethereum has rich developer toolings and biggest communities, complemented with high performance and low gas fees of Solana. Yet to be said, developer experience on Solana still has a lot of room to be improved is our primary reasons why we chose to build on top on Neon.

It was said in the first part, Neon EVM is not a new blockchain that built on top of Solana like L2 or sidechain concept, it is actually a smart contract built on Solana. Neon also allows this smart contract to be flexible to make sure that it is upgradeable at a later time, especially when new Ethereum functionalities is introducted.

After doing an extensive research and deep dive of multiple options for the turf of Opus, we believe that Neon is a fitting place for us. We believe the team is capable of pulling their best effort to make Neon as an alternative for developers to utilize the best of both worlds, and with that being said, Opus will become the frontier of Neon and making sure that our products will be the primary decentralized finance hub pick when users are stepping their foot on Neon.

__Opus will be, and always, exclusive to Neon EVM.__ _We will make your stay here comfortable._
